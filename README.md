# Cosmic

GUI-based cosmology evolution calculator (similar to [Ned Wright's](https://astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html) cosmology calculator).

> It's tested for GNU/Linux. However, it should also work in macOS. If you ever encounter a problem, feel free to create an issue.

## Installation

You can easily install Cosmic by cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/seVenVo1d/cosmic.git

## Requirements

Required packages are given in the `requirements.txt`, and they can be installed via

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, `tkinter` support is required to run Cosmic, and it can be installed by running

in Fedora

    sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

in Ubuntu

    sudo apt install python3-tk

## User Guide

You can run Cosmic by simply typing

    python3 cosmic.py

in the terminal. After you start the program, you'll see a page in this form:

where you can enter the cosmological parameters. After you click submit, the program will produce three plots:

### Comoving Distance vs Redshift
