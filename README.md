# Cosmic

GUI based cosmology evolution calculator (similar to [ICosmos](http://www.icosmos.co.uk/index.html))

> It's tested for GNU/Linux, however it should also work in Windows and Mac OS. If you ever encounter with a problem, feel free to create an issue.

## Installation

Required packages are given in the `requirements.txt` and they can be installed via

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## User Guide

You can run *Cosmic* via

    python3 cosmic.py

Later on you'll see a page in this form, where you can enter the cosmological parameters

After you click submit, the program will produce three plots:

### Comoving Distance vs Redshift
