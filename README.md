# Cosmos-GUI

GUI based cosmology evolution calculator (similar to [ICosmos](http://www.icosmos.co.uk/index.html))

It's tested for Linux but it should also work in Windows OS. If you encounter a problem, feel free to create an issue.

## Installation

Required packages are given in the `requirements.txt` and they can be installed via

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

### 1. Run Cosmos-GUI via

    python3 cosmos_gui.py

### 2. Enter the Cosmological Parameters


After you click submit, the program will produce three plots;

#### a) Comoving Distance vs Redshift


#### b) Angular Diameter Distance vs Redshift


#### c) Luminosity Distance vs Redshift

and finally, you'll see a page that prints the results.
